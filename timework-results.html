  <h1>ðŸ§  Time and Work Quiz - Solutions</h1>

  <div class="solution">
    <div class="question">1. A can do a piece of work in 10 days, and B in 15 days. How long will they take to complete it together?</div>
    <div class="answer">Answer: 6 days</div>
    <div class="explanation">1/A + 1/B = 1/10 + 1/15 = (3 + 2)/30 = 1/6. So, together they finish in 6 days.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="solution">
    <div class="question">2. If A alone can do a work in 20 days, and B alone can do the same work in 30 days, how many days will they take together?</div>
    <div class="answer">Answer: 12 days</div>
    <div class="explanation">1/20 + 1/30 = (3 + 2)/60 = 1/12. So, together they take 12 days.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="solution">
    <div class="question">3. A can complete a work in 12 days. B can complete the same work in 16 days. They worked together for 4 days. What fraction of work is left?</div>
    <div class="answer">Answer: 5/12</div>
    <div class="explanation">Work in 1 day = 1/12 + 1/16 = 7/48. In 4 days = 28/48. Left = 1 - 28/48 = 20/48 = 5/12.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="solution">
    <div class="question">4. A is twice as good a worker as B. If both can do a job in 12 days, how long will B alone take?</div>
    <div class="answer">Answer: 36 days</div>
    <div class="explanation">A = 2B. So, A + B = 3B = 1/12 â†’ B = 1/36 per day. So B takes 36 days.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="solution">
    <div class="question">5. A and B can do a job in 8 days. B and C in 12 days, and C and A in 16 days. Who is the most efficient?</div>
    <div class="answer">Answer: A</div>
    <div class="explanation">Solving the equations shows A does most work per day.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="solution">
    <div class="question">6. If 6 men can complete a work in 12 days, how many men are needed to complete the work in 8 days?</div>
    <div class="answer">Answer: 9</div>
    <div class="explanation">Work = 6Ã—12 = 72 man-days. So for 8 days: 72/8 = 9 men.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="solution">
    <div class="question">7. A and B can do a job together in 10 days. If A alone can do it in 15 days, how long will B alone take?</div>
    <div class="answer">Answer: 30</div>
    <div class="explanation">1/10 = 1/15 + 1/B â†’ 1/B = 1/10 - 1/15 = 1/30 â†’ B = 30 days.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="solution">
    <div class="question">8. A can finish a task in 40 days. He works for 8 days, then B finishes the remaining work in 16 days. How long would B alone take?</div>
    <div class="answer">Answer: 20</div>
    <div class="explanation">A's 8 days = 8/40 = 1/5. Remaining = 4/5. B does 4/5 in 16 days â†’ Full work = 16 Ã— 5/4 = 20 days.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="solution">
    <div class="question">9. 4 men and 6 women can do a work in 10 days. 3 men and 7 women can do the same in 8 days. How many days will 10 women take?</div>
    <div class="answer">Answer: 30</div>
    <div class="explanation">Solve system of equations for individual efficiency.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="solution">
    <div class="question">10. If A can do a piece of work in 5 days and B in 10 days, and they work alternately with A starting first, how long will it take?</div>
    <div class="answer">Answer: 6.5 days</div>
    <div class="explanation">A and B alternate â†’ Work in 2 days = 1/5 + 1/10 = 3/10. Repeat and finish last part with A.</div>
